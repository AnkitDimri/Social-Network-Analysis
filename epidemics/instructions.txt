Instructions to run the R script:

Just compile both the functions in seirs.R and import IGRAPH library

once done with given inputs call the function epidemics

function (lg, seeds, p, t_e, t_i, t_r, itr)

where
lg is the Igraph object
p is the probablity of disease
seeds is the seed nodes you want to infect in the begining
t_e is the time stamp of exposed
t_i is the time stamp of infected
t_r is the time stamp of recovered
itr is the number of iterations you want
